### Challenge 2: Simple Function
*Objective:* Write a function that adds two numbers.
- Define a function add(a, b) that returns the sum of a and b.


### Challenge 3: Conditional Statements
*Objective:* Use an if-else statement to check if a number is positive.
- Write a function checkPositive(number) that prints "Positive" if the number is greater than 0, and "Not Positive" otherwise.


### Challenge 4: Loop Through an Array
*Objective:* Iterate through an array and print each element.
- Write a function printArray(arr) that prints each element of the array arr.


### Challenge 5: String Manipulation
*Objective:* Concatenate two strings.
- Write a function concatStrings(str1, str2) that returns the concatenation of str1 and str2.


### Challenge 6: Object Creation
*Objective:* Create an object with properties.
- Create an object person with properties name, age, and isStudent.


### Challenge 7: Array Methods
*Objective:* Use the map method to create a new array.
- Write a function doubleNumbers(arr) that returns a new array with each element of arr doubled.


### Challenge 8: Filter Method
*Objective:* Use the filter method to create a new array.
- Write a function filterEven(arr) that returns a new array with only the even numbers from arr.

### Challenge 9: Reduce Method
*Objective:* Use the reduce method to calculate the sum of an array.
- Write a function sumArray(arr) that returns the sum of all elements in arr.


### Challenge 10: Function Expressions
*Objective:* Write a function expression.
- Create a function expression multiply that takes two arguments and returns their product.


### Challenge 11: Arrow Functions
*Objective:* Write an arrow function.
- Create an arrow function subtract that takes two arguments and returns their difference.


### Challenge 12: Destructuring Assignment
*Objective:* Use destructuring assignment to extract values from an object.
- Write a function getPersonInfo(person) that uses destructuring to extract name and age from the person object and return them as a string.


### Challenge 13: Template Literals
*Objective:* Use template literals to create a formatted string.
- Write a function formatString(name, age) that returns a formatted string using template literals.


### Challenge 14: Promises
*Objective:* Create and resolve a promise.
- Write a function createPromise(value) that returns a promise which resolves with the given value after 2 seconds.


### Challenge 15: Async/Await
*Objective:* Use async/await to handle a promise.
- Write an async function getValue that awaits the result of createPromise(value) and logs the result.


### Challenge 16: Closures
*Objective:* Create a function that returns another function (closure).
- Write a function createCounter() that returns a function which increments and logs a counter variable.


### Challenge 17: Rest and Spread Operator
*Objective:* Use the rest and spread operators in a function.
- Write a function sumAll that takes any number of arguments and returns their sum using the rest operator.


### Challenge 18: Default Parameters
*Objective:* Use default parameters in a function.
- Write a function greet(name = "Guest") that returns a greeting message with the given name, or "Guest" if no name is provided.


### Challenge 19: DOM Manipulation
*Objective:* Manipulate the DOM using JavaScript.
- Write a function changeText() that changes the text content of an HTML element with the ID demo to "Hello, World!".
